opentok-titanium-mobile
================
A module for the Titanium Mobile platform that uses the Opentok iOS SDK for video streaming capabilities.

Installation
------------
1.  Download the latest release from the [Releases page](opentok-titanium-mobile/releases).

2.  Move the zip file (`com.tokbox.ti.opentok-iphone-x.x.x.zip`) to your application directory, and unzip it
    (e.g. `unzip com.tokbox.ti.opentok-iphone-x.x.x.zip`). The module should now be placed inside the
    `AppRoot/modules/iphone/com.tokbox.ti.opentok/x.x.x/` directory.

Building
------------
If you want to build the code on your own, follow these instructions. If you just want to use the module, scroll down to Usage.

1.  Clone or download the repo, run `./build.py` in the directory

2.  Copy the zip (`com.tokbox.ti.opentok-iphone-x.x.zip`) to your Titanium installation directory:
    `cp com.tokbox.ti.opentok-iphone-x.x.zip ~/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/`.

Usage
-----
1.  Declare the module and the asset path in in your `tiapp.xml` file:
    NOTE: the version attribute of the module tag should match the release you downloaded.

    ```xml
    <modules>
      <module version="x.x.x">com.tokbox.ti.opentok</module>
    </modules>
    <ios>
      <plist>
        <dict>
          <key>OTAssetBundlePath</key>
          <string>modules/com.tokbox.ti.opentok</string>
        </dict>
      </plist>
    </ios>
    ```

2.  Load the module in your application

    ```javascript
    var opentok = require('com.tokbox.ti.opentok');
    ```
	
3.  Create and connect to a session

    ```javascript
    var CONFIG = {
      apiKey: '...',    // Get from your Project page on the Developer Dashboard (https://dashboard.tokbox.com/projects)
      sessionId: '...', // Generated by server-side SDK
      token: '...'      // Generated by server-side SDK
    };
    var session = opentok.createSession({ sessionId: CONFIG.sessionId });
    session.connect(CONFIG.apiKey, CONFIG.token);
    ```
