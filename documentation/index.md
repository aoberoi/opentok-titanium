# opentok Module

## Description

Opentok is an API to stream live video to and from your App on mobile and on the web.
[Find out more online](http://www.tokbox.com/platform).

## Usage

### Accessing the module

To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:

```javascript
var opentok = require("com.tokbox.ti.opentok");
```

The opentok variable is a reference to the Opentok module object.	

### Connecting to a Session

In order to connect to a session, we must first create a Session object and then use it to connect. In order to
configure this we need an [Account](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/signups/new). Then find your API Key on the
[Dashboard Projects](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/keys) page. Lastly, in the Project Tools section, generate a
***Session ID*** and a corresponding ***Token*** and use them to create and connect to a
[Session](session.md#session) as seen below.

```javascript
var apiKey    = '...',  // Get from the OpenTok website (https://dashboard.tokbox.com/keys)
    token     = '...',  // Generated by Project Tools or server-side SDK
    sessionId = '...';  // Generated by Project Tools or server-side SDK

var session = opentok.createSession({ sessionId : sessionId });
session.connect(apiKey, token);
```

### Publishing video to the Session

To start streaming video and audio to other users/devices in the session we must Publish. To start publishing we
first create a [Publisher](publisher.md#publisher). Then to see the video that we are publishing, we add its
[VideoView](videoview.md#videoview) to the current view. All of this can only be done after the session is connected,
so we place it inside the [sessionConnected](session.md#sessionconnected) event handler.

```javascript
var publisher, publisherView;
session.addEventListener("sessionConnected", function(event) {
  publisher = session.publish();
  publisherView = publisher.createView({ width : 320, height : 240, top : 20 });
  // self is an instance of Titanium.UI.View
  self.add(publisherView);
});
```

### Subscribing to video in a Session

To start playing a video stream from another user/device in the Session we must subscribe. To start subscribing
we first create a [Subscriber](subscriber.md#subscriber) from the [Stream](stream.md#stream). Then to see the video
from that Stream, we add its [VideoView](videoview.md#videoview) to the current view. All of this can only be done
after a [Stream](stream.md#stream) is created (and after the session is connected), so we place it inside the
[streamCreated](session.md#streamcreated) event handler. Note: each Stream can only have one Subscriber.

```javascript
var subscriber, subscriberView;
session.addEventListener("streamCreated", function(event) {
  var stream = event.stream;
  subscriber = session.subscribe(stream);
  subscriberView = subscriber.createView({ width : 320, height : 240, top : 20 });
  // self is an instance of Ti.UI.View such as ApplicationView
  self.add(subscriberView);
});
```
