# opentok Module

## Description

Opentok is an API to stream live video to and from your App on mobile and on the web.
[Find out more online](http://www.tokbox.com/platform).

## Usage

### Accessing the module

To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:

```javascript
var opentok = require("com.tokbox.ti.opentok");
```

The opentok variable is a reference to the Opentok module object.	

### Connecting to a Session

In order to connect to a session, we must first create a Session object and then use it to connect. In order to
configure this we need an [Account](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/signups/new). Then find your API Key on the
[Dashboard Projects](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/keys) page. Lastly, in the Project Tools section, generate a
***Session ID*** and a corresponding ***Token*** and use them to create and connect to a
[Session](session.md#session) as seen below.

```javascript
var apiKey    = '...',  // Get from the OpenTok website (https://dashboard.tokbox.com/keys)
    token     = '...',  // Generated by Project Tools or server-side SDK
    sessionId = '...';  // Generated by Project Tools or server-side SDK

var session = opentok.createSession({ sessionId : sessionId });
session.connect(apiKey, token);
```

### Publishing video to the Session

To start streaming video and audio to other users/devices in the session we must Publish. To start publishing we
first create a [Publisher](publisher.md#publisher). Then to see the video that we are publishing, we add its
[VideoView](videoview.md#videoview) to the current view. All of this can only be done after the session is connected,
so we place it inside the [sessionConnected](session.md#sessionconnected) event handler.

```javascript
var publisher, publisherView;
session.addEventListener("sessionConnected", function(event) {
  publisher = session.publish();
  publisherView = publisher.createView({ width : 320, height : 240, top : 20 });
  // self is an instance of Titanium.UI.View
  self.add(publisherView);
});
```

### Subscribing to video in a Session

To start playing a video stream from another user/device in the session we must Subscribe. To start subscribing
we first create a [Subscriber](subscriber.md#subscriber) from the [Stream](stream.md#stream). Then to see the video
from that Stream, we add its [VideoView](videoview.md#videoview) to the current view. All of this can only be done
after a [Stream](stream.md#stream) is created (and after the session is connected), so we place it inside the
[streamCreated](session.md#streamcreated) event handler.

```javascript
var subscriber, subscriberView;
session.addEventListener("streamCreated", function(event) {
  var stream = event.stream;
  subscriber = session.subscribe(stream);
  subscriberView = subscriber.createView({ width : 320, height : 240, top : 20 });
  // self is an instance of Ti.UI.View such as ApplicationView
  self.add(subscriberView);
});
```

### Which Stream belongs to my device? Which Stream is coming from another device?

If you follow the example above, you will first subscribe to your own stream. It would be very useful to know
whether this [Stream](stream.md#stream) is coming from another device or from your own device. To do this, we
compare the [Connection](connection.md#connection) of each [Stream](stream.md#stream) by their
[connectionId](connection.md#connectionid) property.

```javascript
var subscriber, subscriberView;
session.addEventListener("streamCreated", function(event) {
  var stream = event.stream;
  // Filter out any stream that is coming from my own connection. I only want to subscribe to others
  if (stream.connection.connectionId === session.connection.connectionId) { return; }
  subscriber = session.subscriber(stream);
  subscriberView = subscriber.createView({ width : 320, height : 240, top : 20 });
  self.add(subscriberView);
});
```
