# VideoView

VideoViews are simply subtypes of [Titanium.UI.View](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#!/api/Titanium.UI.View) that
have the same properties, methods, and events. They are constructed from either the [Publisher.createView(_props_)](publisher.md#createviewprops)
or the [Subscriber.createView(_props_)](subscriber.md#createview_props_) method.
